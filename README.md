# Create React JQuery Plugin

Easily set up a project to produce a jQuery plugin implemented with the React
framework. The goal is to create a component, which can be distributed
separately from an app or web page, but rather can be added to any page with
jQuery already installed.

## Usage:

```
yarn create react-jquery-plugin my-plugin
```

or one of:

```
npx create-react-jquery-plugin my-plugin
npm init react-jquery-plugin my-plugin
```

## Features

TBD
